  Because checkbox controls usually come in lists, we've scaffolded the following structure to ensure consistency in markup and style.

  * These individual fields are paired with their own `label` elements,
    so the overall label for the whole set is generated with a `.field__label`.
  * The set of fields are grouped inside a `.field-set` group and each contained

  #### Custom Input Styles

  We've also addded a custom form library that allows checkbox controls to have a custom UI.
  By default, the `input` is hidden and an `::before` and `::after` psuedo-element are turned on and styled.
  Use these as hooks to implement further customizations or background icon images.
  A minimal jQuery-based library is attached that ensures the input selection is kept in sync with user interactions.

  #### Inline Tiling

  We've set up `.field-set` components to allow several tiling settings:
  `.field-set--inline` for each item to tile up beside each other
  `.field-set--2-up` for evenly-spaced two columns,
  `.field-set--3-up` for evenly-spaced three columns, and
  `.field-set--4-up` for evenly-spaced four columns.
  See the radio component for an example of this in practice.
